The way in which it is derived means it is not directly linked to any other information on the prescription such as date of prescription. The flag is assigned to a patient based on their address at a particular point in time during a month, therefore all prescriptions for a patient within a particular month will either be assigned a flag Y or N. If a patient gets multiple scripts in a month during which they have moved into/out of a home you may find some scripts are not correctly assigned the flag. |\n|Patient Date of Birth            |Patient's Date of Birth.                                                                                                                                                                                           |will varyaccording toPBPP approval |Can provide at level approved by PBPP, e.g. year and month.
